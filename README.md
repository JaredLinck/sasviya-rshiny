# **R Shiny app with SAS Viya**

## Overview

There is not one solution or programing language that will deliver everything you need. <br/>
That is why customizing the platform you already master is where you find value. <br/>
In order to accomplish this, I've seen customers move directly to coding, in lieu of SAS user interfaces. <br/>
This provides freedom and full control on how things get executed. This holds true for analytics and SAS Viya. 

This app is a low-code that displays SAS integration through APIs with open source languages, particularly R.<br/>

The interface developed in this repository will allow you to:<br/>
1. import data to CAS <br/>
2. build features <br/>
3. train models.<br/>

At the end, the user will have an end-to-end pipeline to test different approaches.
